### First step to coding world is to know how computers work. Computers are everywhere and help people to solve thinking problems like solving equations, tracking stars in the sky and preform several tasks in the same time. It take inputs that tell the computers what to do like keyboard, voices and the camera, store information in memory, processing it by manipulate it or change it to a different type of information and output the results. Computers work on ones and zeros. These ones and zeros play an important role in how computers work on the inside and this is called the binary number system. This binary number system can solves a lot of difficult problems. 
### Smaller computers are faster due to the fact that the smeller the circuit is the less distance the electrical signal has to go and the speed of the electric is static it moves 300000 km/s (speed of light). Computers consist of two main things: Software and Hardware. Software can be anything from apps and games and hardware is the devices that using these software by the central processing unit (CPU)
