#### *first of all, you have to know what is virsion control. Virsion Control: is a system that allow you to see all your various virsions of a file or set of files by recording changes. There are two type of virsion control: Local Version Control and Cloud Version Control. The difference between the two type is Local Version Control is one database on your device that stores changes to files but Cloud version control is multiple database on the specific platform to share, collabrate to devolop, and distribute software's versions like GitHub.com.* 

#### *Now, What is Git exactly? Git is a Cloud Version Control platform that store data in a file system made up of snapshots every time you change something on your project called commit to store a refernce to who did it. it's relies on local operations due to most necessary information can be found in local resources and this allows for process expediency becuase a project's history resides on the local disk. Git can track every single change applied on any file and detect any file corruption or loss of information.*
