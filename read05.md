### =Comparison Operators: Evaluating conditions
#### You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. The result will be a Boolean: True or False.
#### 1.	==  (Is a equal to b ?)
#### 2.	!=  (Is not equal to b ?)
#### 3.	===  (Is a strict equal to b ?)
#### 4.	!==  (Is a strict not equal to b ?)
#### 5.	>  (Is a greater than b ?)
#### 6.	<  (Is a less than b ?)
#### 7.	>=  (Is a greater than or equal to b ?)
#### 8.	<=  (Is a less than or equal to b ?)

### =Logical Operators: are allow you to compare more than one comparison operator
#### 1.	&&  ( Do expression 1 AND expression 2 both evaluate to true ?)
#### 2.	||   ( Do expression 1 OR expression 2, one of them evaluate to true ?)
#### 3.	!    ( True return false / False return true)

### =Loops: checks a condition. If it returns true a code block will run then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false. There are three common types of loops:
#### 1.	FOR: if you need run code a specific numbers of times.
#### 2.	WHILE : if you do not know how many times the code should run
#### 3.	DO WHILE: The Do…While loop is very similar to the while loop, but has one key difference: it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once, even if the condition evaluates to false.

### -Loop counters:

#### A for loop:
#### The form of ( for loop ) is
#### For (var i=0; i<5; i++)
#### { 
#### Statements 
#### }
#### -	Initialization ( var i=0 ) : create a variable and set it 0
#### -	Condition ( I < 5 ) : The value of ( i ) was initially set to 0, so in this case the loop will run 5 times before stopping.
#### -	Update ( i++ ) : to update my counter.

### While loop: 
#### Var I = 1;                         set counter to 1
#### Var msg = ‘ ‘                   meassage
#### While ( I < 10 ) 
#### {
#### Statements 
#### }
